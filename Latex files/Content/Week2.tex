\section{Week 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Met with professor A.K. Lal for help regarding Coding theory.
    \item Decided to implement an algebraic decoding algorithm (most probably BCH codes) as given in the book \textbf{Coding Theory: Algorithms, Architecture and Applications}.
    \item Started learning coding theory from the book and completed upto linear block codes
    \item Continued with group theory and started with basic ring theory.
\end{itemize}
